Problem Description :
- You are given a n x n 2D matrix A representing an image.
- Rotate the image by 90 degrees (clockwise).
- You need to do this in place.
Note: If you end up using an additional array, you will only receive
a partial score.

Example Input :
Input 1:

Output 1:
[[3, 1],[4, 2]]

Input 2:
[[1]]

Output 2:
[[1]]

Example Explanation :
Explanation 1:
- After rotating the matrix by 90 degrees:
- 1 goes to 2, 2 goes to 4
- 4 goes to 3, 3 goes to 1
