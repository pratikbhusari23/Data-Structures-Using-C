Q12. Matrix Transpose using recursion


Problem Description :
- You are given a matrix A, and you have to return another matrix which is the
transpose of A.
- You have to return the Transpose of this 2D matrix.
NOTE: Transpose of a matrix A is defined as - AT[i][j] = A[j][i] ; Where 1 ≤ i ≤ col
and 1 ≤ j ≤ row. The transpose of a matrix switches the element at (i, j)th index to (j, i)th
index, and the element at (j, i)th index to (i, j)th index.

Input :
A = [[1, 2, 3],[4, 5, 6],[7, 8, 9]]
Output :
[[1, 4, 7], [2, 5, 8], [3, 6, 9]]
Explanation :
- after converting rows to columns and columns to rows of
[[1, 2, 3],[4, 5, 6],[7, 8, 9]]
we will get [[1, 4, 7], [2, 5, 8], [3, 6, 9]].
